# Welcome to Pawar 2018 Repo

## Getting started (Mac)
1. Install Docker (www.docker.com)
2. Clone the repo `git clone git@github.com:pawar-2018/pawar2018.git`  
3. Start the docker container `docker-compose up -d`    
4. In another terminal tab, `cd` in to your local clone of the repo and run `npm install`.
5. To start your dev server, run `npm start`. This proxies from localhost:8000, which is where Docker is running, so you do need Docker from step 3 running as well.
6. You might need to restart your vms (docker-compose restart) if you are getting a pawar2018 not found error
7. If you're just running onto merge conficts or want to make sure you build before pushing (this will be fixed when we get deployment more figured out, sorry, because this will get annoying really fast) you can just run `npm run build`.

## Getting started (Windows)
1. Install Docker Toolbox on Windows (https://docs.docker.com/toolbox/toolbox_install_windows/)
2. Clone the repo
````
    git clone git@github.com:pawar-2018/pawar2018.git
````
3. Start the docker container
  1. You might need to change the volumes for Wordpress to:
       ```- /wp-content/themes/pawar2018:/var/www/html/wp-content/themes/pawar2018```
````
    docker-compose up -d
````
4. Open Oracle VM and look for your Docker VM(default)
5. Right click docker VM(default) and select Settings > Shared Folders
6. Mount the location where you clone the repo into by adding a shared folder
    Folder Path EX: C:\github\username\pawar2018\wp-content
    Folder Name EX: wp-content
7. You might need to restart the VM if it doesn't mount the folder path
8. Once you see the files in the VM console(double click the VM for console), fetch your IP in the Docker terminal
with docker-machine ip
9. Go to http://docker-machine-ip-here:8000

## Setting up Wordpress locally

### Choose the Pawar2018 theme

1. Go to `http://localhost:8000/wp-admin/themes.php`

### Importing Content

staging site's content and import into your local Wordpress.
